## Understanding Islamophobia: A Global Phenomenon

**Islamophobia** is the irrational fear, hatred, or prejudice against Islam and Muslims. Since 9/11, this bias has permeated media, politics, and public discourse, often fueled by misinformation and geopolitical tensions ([UN Report](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113842)).

- **Harmful Stereotypes:** Muslims are unfairly portrayed as extremists or threats to national security.
- **Hate Crimes:** Physical and verbal attacks against Muslims have surged worldwide ([FBI Hate-Crime Statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime)).
- **Systemic Discrimination:** Muslim individuals face barriers in employment, travel, and civil rights.

Islamophobia is not just a social issue‚Äîit‚Äôs a **global human-rights challenge** that undermines societal harmony.

**Primary Keywords:** Islamophobia, prejudice, hate crimes, discrimination, stereotypes
